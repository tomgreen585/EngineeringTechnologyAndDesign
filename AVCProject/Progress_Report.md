# ENGR101 Analysis of project progress

So far the project has gone completely to plan. We have been able to complete the Core components on time and have made initial progress on Completion sections. This was largely helped by having good communication and collaboration between team members during the development phases of the project. The only notable shortcoming of the project so far is trouble testing the code, though we are confident that this will be resolved and it will not affect the final outcome.

We have encountered very few bottlenecks that limit our production capability, only that conflicting schedules make coordinating meeting times difficult. However, we are using a  group discord server which helps to negate this issue.

To advance the project further, the plan is to finish development of the completion section and begin to conceptualise ideas on solutions for the Challenge section of the assignment. We will continue to help each other develop our assigned portions of code, then meet together to draft ideas and assign tasks to finish the project.
